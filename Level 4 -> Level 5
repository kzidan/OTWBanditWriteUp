*Information*
CTF Name: Bandit Level 4 -> Level 5
Profile: OverTheWire
Difficulty: Easy
Description: The purpose of this challenge is to teach users how to find additional information about files, including the type of data stored in them

*Content*
1) Connected to new level through using the username bandit4, with the password as the flag from the previous level. (A breakdown of the ssh 
command can be found in level0)
2) Used 'cd inhere' command to switch directories
3) Used 'ls' command to view files in directory, got the results '-file00  -file01  -file02  -file03  -file04  -file05  -file06  -file07  -file08  -file09'
4) Used 'file ./-file*' command to view data
          ^       ^
       command    |
adds  a '*' to the end of the beginning of the file name so that it iterates through all the files starting with '-file'
5) Used 'cat ./-file07' command to read the file after seeing that it is in ASCII whereas the other files are listed as data

The type of data in a file can be seen through the use of the file command. ASCII is a human readable datatype so we can assume that it countains the 
password, as the challenge specified that it would.
