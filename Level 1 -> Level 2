1) Connected to new level through using the username bandit2, with the password as the flag from the previous level. (A breakdown of the ssh 
command can be found in level0)

                 ^

              command
              
File names that include dashes can cause problems in linux, including when using the cat command. The '-' is usually reserved for flags and as a result
using them in file names can confuse the system. To get around this, you can use quotation marks around the file name, or use the method I used above which
is to add a './' to the front of the file name.
