1) Connected to new level through using the username bandit2, with the password as the flag from the previous level. (A breakdown of the ssh 
command can be found in level0)
2) Used ls command to find file
3) Used command cat ./-

              command
              
File names that include dashes can cause problems in linux, including when using the cat command. The '-' is usually reserved for flags and as a result
using them in file names can confuse the system. To get around this, you can use quotation marks around the file name, or use the method I used above which
is to add a './' to the front of the file name.
