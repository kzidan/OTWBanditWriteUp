A directory is a type of file in linux whose purpose is to store file information. By switching directories we can access files that are stored in the
directory we have switched to. Some files can be hidden when using the generic 'ls' command, by adding the flag '-a', ('a' stands for all), we can see 
additional files that start with a '.'
